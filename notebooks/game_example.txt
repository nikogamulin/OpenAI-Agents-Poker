   'The hand 10 of Spades and Queen of Clubs has potential, especially considering the game is in the pre-flop stage and no community cards have been revealed yet.

The decision to call also takes into account the shallow stack size (10 chips), making it risky to play aggressively without a stronger hand or more information from community cards.',
